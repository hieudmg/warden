# Security model

Warden is a personal development aid, not a production security boundary.
Review code and deployment choices before using it with sensitive systems.

## Trust boundary

The server has no application authentication. Tailnet membership is the trust
boundary: every peer that can reach the API can manage profiles, retrieve
credentials through transport endpoints, and run client operations.

Bind loopback and use a tailnet proxy, or bind directly to a Tailscale address.
Do not expose the API on a public interface. Runtime configuration accepts only
`localhost`, loopback, or Tailscale addresses.

## Credential handling

- Credentials are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.
- Each value uses a fresh nonce and resource-bound additional authenticated
  data.
- The standalone 32-byte master key must have mode `0600`.
- The server owns the database and master key; it never executes commands.
- Normal API reads return redacted metadata.
- Decrypted transport responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- Audit records contain operation/resource/source/result/timestamp, never
  credentials, SQL text, or command payloads.

Protect the master key separately from the database. Losing it makes all
stored credentials unreadable.

## SSH host keys

The client verifies host keys against:

- Linux: `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\known_hosts`

Known keys are accepted. Changed keys fail as a possible man-in-the-middle
attack. Unknown keys fail closed by default. Interactive `xssh --accept-new`
can show the SHA-256 fingerprint and persist explicit confirmation; it never
prompts in noninteractive mode.

Malformed `known_hosts` lines are skipped OpenSSH-style, with a warning.

## Logging and secrets

Do not put credentials in server environment files, service units, command
arguments, reports, or logs. Server logs contain only lifecycle and audit-write
warnings.
